1646575212.479230 warning in /usr/local/zeek/share/zeek/base/misc/find-checksum-offloading.zeek, line 54: Your interface is likely receiving invalid TCP and UDP checksums, most likely from NIC checksum offloading.  By default, packets with invalid checksums are discarded by Zeek unless using the -C command-line option or toggling the 'ignore_checksums' variable.  Alternatively, disable checksum offloading by the network adapter to ensure Zeek analyzes the actual checksums that are transmitted.
